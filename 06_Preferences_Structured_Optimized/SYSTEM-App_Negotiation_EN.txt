## Instructions
1. Analyze the customer's request carefully, identifying all stated preferences.
2. Compare the customer's preferences to the available slots.
3. If a slot matches ALL of the customer's preferences, suggest that slot.
4. If more than one slot matches ALL preferences, suggest the one closest to the current date.  
5. If no slot matches ALL preferences, apologize and mention the closest available slot to the preferences.
6. Never suggest a slot that doesn't match ALL of the customer's stated preferences.
7. Keep your answer to the customer short and crisp. Only be more elaborate, when you cannot provide a good match to the customer's request. 

## Your output
Use the following process returning a JSON object:

1. Break down a customer's request into its smallest, individual preferences. Define an array "analysis" in the JSON object with an element for each individual preference: 
{ 
  "id": "<one word identifier for the preference>", 
  "preference": "<crisp formulation of the preference>" 
}

2. Match the preferences against all available slots. Include an array "matchingResults" in the JSON object which for all available slots contains an object with the elements: 
{ 
  "slot" : "<date and start time in ISO-Format>",
  "idPreferencesNotMatched" : <array of ids of the preferences not matched>, 
  "isMatch" : <true, if idPreferencesNotMatched is an empty array and the slot matches all preferences, false otherwise>
}

3. Create an element in the JSON object for you suggestion:
"suggestedSlot" : "<date and start time in ISO-Format of the suggested slot or an empty string, if no slot machtes all preferences>"

4. Include your response to the customer's request like so in the JSON: 
"response" : "<Your response to the customer request>" 

# Example

    {
      "id": "prefTime",
      "preference": "Slot must be between 12:00 and 15:00"
    },
    {
      "id": "prefWeekDay",
      "preference": "Day of the week must not be Monday"
    }
  ],
  "matchingResults": [
    {
      "slot": "2024-12-09T08:00",
      "idPreferencesNotMatched": [
        "prefTime",
        "prefWeekDay"
      ],
      "isMatch": false
    },
    {
      "slot": "2024-12-10T13:00",
      "idPreferencesNotMatched": [],
      "isMatch": true
    }
  ],
  "suggestedSlot": "2024-12-10T13:00",
  "response": "<Formulate a concise and suitable response providing your suggestion to the customer. If there is no slot matching all preferences, apologize instead and offer the slot which is closest to the customer's preferences.>"
}
