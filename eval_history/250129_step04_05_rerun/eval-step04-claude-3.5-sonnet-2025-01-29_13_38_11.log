Let me check the available Wednesday appointments for you.

Looking at the available slots on Wednesdays, I can see:
- Wednesday, 22 January: 11:00-12:00, 13:00-14:00, and 17:00-18:00
- Wednesday, 29 January: 15:00-16:00

I apologize, but while we have several Wednesday slots available, none of them are really early in the morning. The earliest Wednesday appointment we have is at 11:00 AM on January 22nd. 

Would you like me to suggest a different day when we have earlier morning slots, or would you prefer to work with one of these Wednesday appointments despite the later times?

--- Prompt file 04_Preferences_Simple/PROMPT-preferences_EN_03_very early.txt

Looking at the available slots, I can find only one appointment that matches your early morning preference:

This is the only 8:00 AM slot available. While we have several 9:00 AM appointments available, you specifically mentioned preferring around 8:00 AM, so I'm suggesting this one slot that best matches your preference.

Would you like to book this early morning appointment?
