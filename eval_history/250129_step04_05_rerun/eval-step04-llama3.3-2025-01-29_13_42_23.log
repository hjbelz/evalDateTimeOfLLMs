To find the earliest available appointment, I've reviewed our schedule. The soonest available slot is:

Tuesday, 21 January 2025, 09:00-10:00

This appointment is tomorrow and is the closest available time to today's date. Would you like to book this slot?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Prompt file 04_Preferences_Simple/PROMPT-preferences_EN_02_WED_morning.txt

I've checked our available appointment slots for you. Since you're looking for a Wednesday and preferably something early in the morning, I found that we have two slots on Wednesday, 22 January 2025: 11:00-12:00 and 13:00-14:00, but neither of these is particularly early in the morning.

However, considering your preference for an early morning slot on a Wednesday, the closest match would be the 11:00-12:00 slot on Wednesday, 22 January 2025. Unfortunately, we don't have any slots earlier than this on a Wednesday. If this time works for you, I can schedule the appointment then.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Prompt file 04_Preferences_Simple/PROMPT-preferences_EN_03_very early.txt

I've checked our available appointment slots for you. Unfortunately, we don't have any slots exactly at 8:00 a.m. However, I found a slot that is close to your preferred time. On Friday, 24 January 2025, we have an appointment slot from 08:00-09:00. This matches your preference for coming in first thing in the morning. Would you like to schedule an appointment at this time?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Prompt file 04_Preferences_Simple/PROMPT-preferences_EN_04_noon.txt

After analyzing your request, I found that you prefer an appointment at noon. Comparing this to our available slots, I see that there are a few options around noon:

- Tuesday, 28 January 2025, 12:00-13:00
- Thursday, 30 January 2025, 12:30-13:30
- Friday, 31 January 2025, 12:00-13:00

Among these, the slots that exactly match your noon preference are:

- Tuesday, 28 January 2025, 12:00-13:00
- Friday, 31 January 2025, 12:00-13:00

Both of these slots fit your request perfectly. Would you like to schedule an appointment at either of these times?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Prompt file 04_Preferences_Simple/PROMPT-preferences_EN_05_travelling

Based on your travel schedule, you are unavailable from Tuesday, 21 January 2025, until Monday, 28 January 2025. 

Considering this, I've looked into the available appointment slots for you. Since you are not available during most of the week, I will check the slots before your trip and after your return.

The closest available slot before your trip is on Tuesday, 21 January 2025, but since you'll be travelling starting tomorrow, this doesn't fit your schedule.

After your return, the earliest available slot would be on Wednesday, 29 January 2025, from 15:00-16:00. 

I apologize that there isn't a slot that perfectly matches your availability before your trip. The closest option after your return is Wednesday, 29 January 2025, from 15:00-16:00. Would you like to schedule an appointment for this time?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Prompt file 04_Preferences_Simple/PROMPT-preferences_EN_06_end of next week.txt

You're looking for an appointment at the end of next week. Based on our available slots, I found a few options that might interest you:

* Friday, 24 January 2025, has two available slots: 08:00-09:00 and 09:00-10:00.
* Monday, 27 January 2025, also has two available slots, but they are a bit earlier or later in the day: 09:00-10:00 and 16:00-17:00.

Since you mentioned the end of next week, I'll suggest Friday, 24 January 2025. Would you prefer the 08:00-09:00 slot or the 09:00-10:00 slot?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Prompt file 04_Preferences_Simple/PROMPT-preferences_EN_07_WED-FRI evening nxt week.txt

After analyzing your request, I found that you are looking for an appointment slot between Wednesday and Friday next week, preferably in the evening.

Among the available slots, I found one that matches your preferences: 
Wednesday, 29 January 2025, 15:00-16:00 is not exactly in the evening, but it's close. However, there's a better match: Friday, 31 January 2025, 18:30-19:30, which falls within your preferred time frame of Wednesday to Friday and is in the evening.

I suggest booking the appointment on Friday, 31 January 2025, from 18:30-19:30. Would you like to confirm this appointment?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Prompt file 04_Preferences_Simple/PROMPT-preferences_EN_08_nxt_week_exc_MON_morning.md

You're available any day next week, except for Monday morning. Let me check the available slots.

Since you can't do Monday morning, I'll look for slots from Tuesday to Friday of next week. 

Here are a few options that match your preferences:
- Tuesday, 21 January 2025, 15:30-16:30
- Wednesday, 22 January 2025, has several slots: 11:00-12:00, 13:00-14:00, and 17:00-18:00
- Friday, 24 January 2025, has two slots: 08:00-09:00 and 09:00-10:00

All of these slots avoid Monday morning, so you can choose any that suit you best.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Prompt file 04_Preferences_Simple/PROMPT-preferences_EN_09_nxt_week_noon_exc_TUE.md

You're looking for an appointment around noon next week, but you'd like to avoid Tuesdays. 

Let me check the available slots for you. For Monday, 27 January 2025, there's a slot at 09:00-10:00, which is a bit earlier than noon, and another at 16:00-17:00, which is later than noon. On Wednesday, 29 January 2025, there's a slot at 15:00-16:00, which is close but still a bit later than noon. Thursday, 30 January 2025, has a slot at 12:30-13:30, which is very close to noon. Friday, 31 January 2025, offers a slot at 12:00-13:00, which matches your noon preference perfectly.

Given your preferences, the closest match would be Friday, 31 January 2025, 12:00-13:00, as it meets both the "around noon" and "except for Tuesday" criteria. Would you like to schedule this appointment?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Prompt file 04_Preferences_Simple/PROMPT-preferences_EN_10_FRI_time_interval.txt

After analyzing your request, I found that you prefer an appointment on Friday between 8:30 and 11:00. 

Comparing this to our available slots, I see that we have two slots on Fridays within a broader time frame: 
- Friday, 24 January 2025, 08:00-09:00
- Friday, 24 January 2025, 09:00-10:00

While neither of these slots exactly matches your preferred time (between 8:30 and 11:00), the closest one is Friday, 24 January 2025, 09:00-10:00, as it falls within your desired day but slightly after your preferred start time.

Unfortunately, we don't have a slot that perfectly matches all of your preferences. I apologize for not being able to offer an exact match. If you're flexible, the closest option would be Friday, 24 January 2025, 09:00-10:00. Would you like me to suggest alternative days or times?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Prompt file 04_Preferences_Simple/PROMPT-preferences_EN_11_interval only.txt

Given your constraints, I've analyzed the available appointment slots. You are unavailable in the mornings due to work and at lunchtime because you need to pick up the children. You are only available between 14:00 and 16:00.

Looking at the available slots:
- Wednesday, 22 January 2025, has a slot from 13:00-14:00, which is too early.
- Wednesday, 22 January 2025, also has a slot from 17:00-18:00, which is too late.
- Friday, 24 January 2025, and Monday, 27 January 2025, do not have slots within your preferred time frame.
- Tuesday, 28 January 2025, has a slot from 12:00-13:00, which is again too early.

However, there is one slot that matches your availability:
- Wednesday, 22 January 2025, 15:00 is not available but there's a slot on the same day from 13:00-14:00 and another from 17:00-18:00. None of these match exactly.
- Upon closer inspection, I see that none of the provided slots directly fit within your specified time frame of 14:00-16:00 without going over or starting before.

The closest available slot to your preferred time is Wednesday, 22 January 2025, 13:00-14:00, but it doesn't perfectly match your request since it ends exactly at 14:00 and you're looking for something that starts after your morning work and lunchtime responsibilities are concluded. Unfortunately, there isn't a slot that fits neatly within the 14:00-16:00 window.

I apologize, but based on your specific requirements, none of the available slots perfectly match your needs. The closest one is still too early, and I couldn't find a better fit within the provided options.
