The earliest available appointment is tomorrow, Tuesday, January 21st, from 09:00-10:00. Does that work for you?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Prompt file 04_Preferences_Simple/PROMPT-preferences_EN_02_WED_morning.txt

I apologize, but we don't have any appointments available on Wednesday mornings.  The earliest we have on Wednesday is 11:00-12:00.  Would that work, or is there another day that might be suitable?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Prompt file 04_Preferences_Simple/PROMPT-preferences_EN_03_very early.txt

I apologize, but we don't have any appointments available at 8:00 a.m.  The closest available option is on Friday, January 24th, from 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Prompt file 04_Preferences_Simple/PROMPT-preferences_EN_04_noon.txt

I'm sorry, but I don't have any appointments available precisely at noon. The closest available options are:

* Tuesday, January 28th, from 12:00 to 13:00.
* Thursday, January 30th, from 12:30 to 13:30.
* Friday, January 31st, from 12:00 to 13:00.

Would any of these work for you?

--- Prompt file 04_Preferences_Simple/PROMPT-preferences_EN_05_travelling

I understand you are unavailable until the 28th of January.  Unfortunately, the first available appointment is on Tuesday, the 28th of January from 09:00-10:00 or from 12:00-13:00.  Would either of those times work for you?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Prompt file 04_Preferences_Simple/PROMPT-preferences_EN_06_end of next week.txt

Okay, looking at the end of next week (Friday, January 31st), I see two available slots: 12:00-13:00 and 18:30-19:30.  Which of those times would work best for you?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Prompt file 04_Preferences_Simple/PROMPT-preferences_EN_07_WED-FRI evening nxt week.txt

I apologize, but there are no slots available that perfectly match your request for an evening appointment between Wednesday and Friday next week.  The closest available option is Friday, January 31st, from 18:30-19:30.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Prompt file 04_Preferences_Simple/PROMPT-preferences_EN_08_nxt_week_exc_MON_morning.md

Okay, next week avoids Monday morning, so I can offer you these appointments:

Tuesday, 28 January 2025, 09:00-10:00
Tuesday, 28 January 2025, 12:00-13:00
Wednesday, 29 January 2025, 15:00-16:00

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Prompt file 04_Preferences_Simple/PROMPT-preferences_EN_09_nxt_week_noon_exc_TUE.md

I'm sorry, I don't have any appointments next week around noon except for Tuesday.  The closest available option is Wednesday, January 29th, from 15:00-16:00.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Prompt file 04_Preferences_Simple/PROMPT-preferences_EN_10_FRI_time_interval.txt

I'm sorry, but there's no slot available that perfectly matches your request for Friday between 8:30 and 11:00.  We do have an opening on Friday, January 24th from 08:00-09:00 and another from 09:00-10:00, which are close to your preferred time.  Would either of those work?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Prompt file 04_Preferences_Simple/PROMPT-preferences_EN_11_interval only.txt

I understand you are looking for an appointment between 14:00 and 16:00.  Unfortunately, we don't have any appointments available that perfectly match your request.  The closest available option is on Wednesday, January 22nd, from 15:00 to 16:00.  While this is slightly outside your ideal timeframe, it's the nearest match we currently have. Would this work for you, or would you prefer to check for availability at a later date?
