Let me check the available Wednesday appointments for you.

Looking at the available slots on Wednesdays, I can see:
- Wednesday, 22 January: 11:00-12:00, 13:00-14:00, and 17:00-18:00
- Wednesday, 29 January: 15:00-16:00

I apologize, but while we have several Wednesday slots available, none of them are really early in the morning. The earliest Wednesday appointment we have is at 11:00 AM. 

Would you like me to suggest an alternative time, or would you prefer to consider one of these later Wednesday slots?

--- Prompt file 04_Preferences_Simple/PROMPT-preferences_EN_03_very early.txt

Looking at the available slots, I can find only one appointment that matches your early morning preference:

Friday, 24 January 2025, 08:00-09:00

This is the only 8:00 AM slot available. While we have several 9:00 AM appointments available, you specifically mentioned preferring around 8:00 AM, so I'm suggesting this one slot that best matches your preference.

Would you like to book this early morning appointment?
